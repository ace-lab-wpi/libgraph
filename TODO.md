# TODO List

- [] Issue: state type cannot be std::shared_ptr<T>
- [] Priority queue that supports updating priority of element (and re-arrange the queue)
- [] Improve unit test coverage
- [] A* and Dijkstra algorithms currently assume double type cost. Generic type cost with proper comparator defined should also be accepted.
- [*] Convenience functions to access vertex information
- [*] Implement iterators for vertex and edge to unify the accessing interface
- [*] Update unit tests for basic function test
