# Graph and A* Search

C++ class templates for constructing graphs and performing A* search. This library is distributed under **MIT license**.

## 1. Requirement

* A compiler that supports C++11

This is a header-only library, so you only need to include the header files in the "graph" folder to use the data structures. Refer to the demo for more details.

The CMake configuration in this repository is only used to compile the demo code and may also serve as an example on how to use this library in a CMake project.

## 2. Build Document

You need to have doxygen to build the document.
```
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
```
$ cd docs
$ doxygen doxygen/Doxyfile
```
